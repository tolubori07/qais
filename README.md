# Uses Vite and bun but npm should work fine. NOTE: DO NOT USE P_X
- in the slope_deflection folder, there is a folder called base, in base there is a folder called api, in api there is a file called utils.py, i updated it to accept the incoming data from the frontend as variables to be used in the main program.
# Install node from here https://nodejs.org/en/download/current
then when it is installed
clone the project from git using:
## git clone https://github.com/tolubori07/qais.git
then to run the backend, cd into the main folder called 'qais', the cd into 'slope_deflection'
to run the server do : Python3 manage.py runserver
open a new terminal window
then cd into the folder called frontend
then do "npm run dev"

### Good luck soldier
